theirfragrant voices sounded softly in his ear telling of their dyingsisters and of the joy it gives to bring happiness to the weakand sorrowing</s>  but he drew the dark mantle closer over his breastand answered coldlyi cannot grant your prayer little fairy it is my willthe flowers should die</s>  go back to your queen and tell herthat i cannot yield my power to please these foolish flowers</s> then violet hung the wreath above the throne and with weary footwent forth again out into the cold dark gardens and still thegolden shadows followed her and wherever they fell flowers bloomedand green leaves rustled</s> then came the frostspirits and beneath their cold wings theflowers died while the spirits bore violet to a low dark cellsaying as they left her that their king was angry that she had daredto stay when he had bid her go</s> so all alone she sat and sad thoughts of her happy home came backto her and she wept bitterly</s>  but soon came visions of the gentleflowers dying in their forest homes and their voices ringingin her ear imploring her to save them</s>  then she wept no longerbut patiently awaited what might come</s> soon the golden light gleamed faintly through the cell and she heardlittle voices calling for help and high up among the heavy cobwebshung poor little flies struggling to free themselves while theircruel enemies sat in their nets watching their pain</s> with her wand the fairy broke the bands that held them tenderly boundup their broken wings and healed their wounds while they lay in thewarm light and feebly hummed their thanks to their kind deliverer</s> then she went to the ugly brown spiders and in gentle wordstold them how in fairy land their kindred spun all the elfin clothand in return the fairies gave them food and then how happily theylived among the green leaves spinning garments for their neighbors</s> and you too said she shall spin for me and i will give youbetter food than helpless insects</s>  you shall live in peaceand spin your delicate threads into a mantle for the stern kingand i will weave golden threads amid the gray that when folded overhis cold heart gentle thoughts may enter in and make it their home</s> and while she gayly sung the little weavers spun their silkenthreads the flies on glittering wings flew lovingly above her headand over all the golden light shone softly down</s> when the frostspirits told their king he greatly wondered andoften stole to look at the sunny little room where friends and enemiesworked peacefully together</s>  still the light grew brighter andfloated out into the cold air where it hung like bright cloudsabove the dreary gardens whence all the spirits power could notdrive it and green leaves budded on the naked trees andflowers bloomed but the spirits heaped snow upon them andthey bowed their heads and died</s> at length the mantle was finished and amid the gray threadsshone golden ones making it bright and she sent it to the kingentreating him to wear it for it would bring peace and loveto dwell within his breast</s> but he scornfully threw it aside and bade his spirits take herto a colder cell deep in the earth and there with harsh wordsthey left her</s> still she sang gayly on and the falling drops kept time so musicallythat the king in his cold icehalls wondered at the low sweet soundsthat came stealing up to him</s> thus violet dwelt and each day the golden light grew stronger andfrom among the crevices of the rocky walls came troops of littlevelvetcoated moles praying that they might listen to the sweetmusic and lie in the warm light</s> we lead said they a dreary life in the cold earth theflowerroots are dead and no soft dews descend for us to drinkno little seed or leaf can we find</s>  ah good fairy let us beyour servants give us but a few crumbs of your daily bread and wewill do all in our power to serve you</s> and violet said yes so day after day they labored to makea pathway through the frozen earth that she might reach the rootsof the withered flowers and soon wherever through the dark galleriesshe went the soft light fell upon the roots of flowers and theywith new life spread forth in the warm ground and forced fresh sapto the blossoms above</s>  brightly they bloomed and danced in thesoft light and the frostspirits tried in vain to harm them for whenthey came beneath the bright clouds their power to do evil left them</s> from his dark castle the king looked out on the happy flowerswho nodded gayly to him and in sweet colors strove to tell himof the good little spirit who toiled so faithfully belowthat they might live</s>  and when he turned from the brightness withoutto his stately palace it seemed so cold and dreary that he foldedviolets mantle round him and sat beneath the faded wreath upon hisicecarved throne wondering at the strange warmth that came from ittill at length he bade his spirits bring the little fairy fromher dismal prison</s> soon they came hastening back and prayed him to come and seehow lovely the dark cell had grown</s>  the rough floor was spreadwith deep green moss and over wall and roof grew flowery vinesfilling the air with their sweet breath while above played the clearsoft light casting rosy shadows on the glittering drops that layamong the fragrant leaves and beneath the vines stood violetcasting crumbs to the downy little moles who ran fearlessly aboutand listened as she sang to them</s> when the old king saw how much fairer she had made the dreary cellthan his palace rooms gentle thoughts within whispered him to granther prayer and let the little fairy go back to her friends and homebut the frostspirits breathed upon the flowers and bid him see howfrail they were and useless to a king</s>  then the stern cold thoughtscame back again and he harshly bid her follow him</s> with a sad farewell to her little friends she followed him andbefore the throne awaited his command</s>  when the king saw how pale andsad the gentle face had grown how thin her robe and weak her wingsand yet how lovingly the golden shadows fell around her and brightenedas they lay upon the wand which guided by patient love had madehis once desolate home so bright he could not be cruel to the onewho had done so much for him and in kindly tone he saidlittle fairy i offer you two things and you may choosebetween them</s>  if i will vow never more to harm the flowers you maylove will you go back to your own people and leave me and my spiritsto work our will on all the other flowers that bloom</s>  the earthis broad and we can find them in any land then why should you carewhat happens to their kindred if your own are safe</s>  will you do this</s> ah</s>  answered violet sadly do you not know that beneaththe flowers bright leaves there beats a little heart that lovesand sorrows like our own</s>  and can i heedless of their beautydoom them to pain and grief that i might save my own dear blossomsfrom the cruel foes to which i leave them</s>  ah no</s>  sooner would idwell for ever in your darkest cell than lose the love of thosewarm trusting hearts</s> then listen said the king to the task i give you</s>  you shallraise up for me a palace fairer than this and if you can workthat miracle i will grant your prayer or lose my kingly crown</s> and now go forth and begin your task my spirits shall not harm youand i will wait till it is done before i blight another flower</s> then out into the gardens went violet with a heavy heart forshe had toiled so long her strength was nearly gone</s>  but theflowers whispered their gratitude and folded their leaves as if theyblessed her and when she saw the garden filled with loving friendswho strove to cheer and thank her for her care courage and strengthreturned and raising up thick clouds of mist that hid her from thewondering flowers alone and trustingly she began her work</s> as time went by the frostking feared the task had beentoo hard for the fairy sounds were heard behind the walls of mistbright shadows seen to pass within but the little voice was neverheard</s>  meanwhile the golden light had faded from the gardenthe flowers bowed their heads and all was dark and cold as whenthe gentle fairy came</s> and to the stern king his home seemed more desolate and sad forhe missed the warm light the happy flowers and more than allthe gay voice and bright face of little violet</s>  so he wanderedthrough his dreary palace wondering how he had been contentto live before without sunlight and love</s> and little violet was mourned as dead in fairyland and many tearswere shed for the gentle fairy was beloved by all from the queendown to the humblest flower</s>  sadly they watched over every birdand blossom which she had loved and strove to be like her inkindly words and deeds</s>  they wore cypress wreaths and spoke of heras one whom they should never see again</s> thus they dwelt in deepest sorrow till one day there came to them anunknown messenger wrapped in a dark mantle who looked with wonderingeyes on the bright palace and flowercrowned elves who kindlywelcomed him and brought fresh dew and rosy fruit to refresh theweary stranger</s>  then he told them that he came from the frostkingwho begged the queen and all her subjects to come and see the palacelittle violet had built for the veil of mist would soon be withdrawnand as she could not make a fairer home than the icecastle the kingwished her kindred near to comfort and to bear her home</s>  and whilethe elves wept he told them how patiently she had toiled howher fadeless love had made the dark cell bright and beautiful</s> these and many other things he told them for little violet had wonthe love of many of the frostspirits and even when they killed theflowers she had toiled so hard to bring to life and beauty she spokegentle words to them and sought to teach them how beautiful is love</s> long stayed the messenger and deeper grew his wonder that the fairycould have left so fair a home to toil in the dreary palace of hiscruel master and suffer cold and weariness to give life and joy tothe weak and sorrowing</s>  when the elves had promised they would comehe bade farewell to happy fairyland and flew sadly home</s> at last the time arrived and out in his barren garden under a canopyof dark clouds sat the frostking before the misty wall behind whichwere heard low sweet sounds as of rustling trees and warbling birds</s> soon through the air came manycolored troops of elves</s>  first thequeen known by the silver lilies on her snowy robe and the brightcrown in her hair beside whom flew a band of elves in crimson andgold making sweet music on their flowertrumpets while all aroundwith smiling faces and bright eyes fluttered her loving subjects</s> on they came like a flock of brilliant butterflies their shiningwings and manycolored garments sparkling in the dim air and soonthe leafless trees were gay with living flowers and their sweetvoices filled the gardens with music</s>  like his subjects the kinglooked on the lovely elves and no longer wondered that little violetwept and longed for her home</s>  darker and more desolate seemed hisstately home and when the fairies asked for flowers he felt ashamedthat he had none to give them</s> at length a warm wind swept through the gardens and the mistcloudspassed away while in silent wonder looked the frostking andthe elves upon the scene before them</s> far as eye could reach were tall green trees whose drooping boughsmade graceful arches through which the golden light shone softlymaking bright shadows on the deep green moss below where the fairestflowers waved in the cool wind and sang in their low sweet voiceshow beautiful is love</s> flowering vines folded their soft leaves around the treesmaking green pillars of their rough trunks</s>  fountains threw theirbright waters to the roof and flocks of silverwinged birds flewsinging among the flowers or brooded lovingly above their nests</s> doves with gentle eyes cooed among the green leaves snowwhite cloudsfloated in the sunny shy and the golden light brighter than beforeshone softly down</s> soon through the long aisles came violet flowers and green leavesrustling as she passed</s>  on she went to the frostkings thronebearing two crowns one of sparkling icicles the other of purewhite lilies and kneeling before him saidmy task is done and thanks to the spirits of earth and air i havemade as fair a home as elfin hands can form</s>  you must now decide</s> will you be king of flowerland and own my gentle kindred for yourloving friends</s>  will you possess unfading peace and joy and thegrateful love of all the green earths fragrant children</s>  then takethis crown of flowers</s>  but if you can find no pleasure herego back to your own cold home and dwell in solitude and darknesswhere no ray of sunlight or of joy can enter</s> send forth your spirits to carry sorrow and desolation overthe happy earth and win for yourself the fear and hatred of thosewho would so gladly love and reverence you</s>  then take this glitteringcrown hard and cold as your own heart will be if you will shut outall that is bright and beautiful</s>  both are before you</s>  choose</s> the old king looked at the little fairy and saw how lovinglythe bright shadows gathered round her as if to shield herfrom every harm the timid birds nestled in her bosom and theflowers grew fairer as she looked upon them while her gentle friendswith tears in their bright eyes folded their hands beseechinglyand smiled on her</s> kind thought came thronging to his mind and he turned to look atthe two palaces</s>  violets so fair and beautiful with its rustlingtrees calm sunny skies and happy birds and flowers all createdby her patient love and care</s>  his own so cold and dark and drearyhis empty gardens where no flowers could bloom no green trees dwellor gay birds sing all desolate and dimand while he gazed his ownspirits casting off

mightier than fear</s>  choose the flower crown and we will bethe truest subjects you have ever had</s> then amid a burst of wild sweet music the frostking placedthe flower crown on his head and knelt to little violet while farand near over the broad green earth sounded the voices of flowerssinging their thanks to the gentle fairy and the summer windwas laden with perfumes which they sent as tokens of their gratitudeand wherever she went old trees bent down to fold their slenderbranches round her flowers laid their soft faces against her ownand whispered blessings even the humble moss bent over the littlefeet and kissed them as they passed</s> the old king surrounded by the happy fairies sat in violetslovely home and watched his icy castle melt away beneath the brightsunlight while his spirits cold and gloomy no longer dancedwith the elves and waited on their king with loving eagerness</s> brighter grew the golden light gayer sang the birds and theharmonious voices of grateful

violets name</s>  mong the green trees was it whispered and the bright waves bore it on to the lonely forest flowers where the glad news had not gone</s>  thus the frostking lost his kingdom and his power to harm and blight</s>  violet conquered and his cold heart warmed with music love and light and his fair home once so dreary gay with lovely elves and flowers brought a joy that never faded

all flowerland was taught the power of love by gentle deeds that little violet wrought</s> as sunny lock ceased another little elf came forward and this wasthe tale silver wing told</s> evas visit to

wonderingwhere the waters went she heard a faint low sound as of faroffmusic</s>  she thought it was the wind but not a leaf was stirringand soon through the rippling water came a strange little boat</s> it was a lily of the valley whose tall stem formed the mastwhile the broad leaves that rose from the roots and drooped againtill they reached the water were filled with gay little elveswho danced to the music of the silver lilybells above that ranga merry peal and filled the air with their fragrant breath</s> on came the fairy boat till it reached a mossgrown rock and hereit stopped while the fairies rested beneath the violetleavesand sang with the dancing waves</s> eva looked with wonder on their gay faces and bright garments andin the joy of her heart sang too and threw crimson

cloverblossoms said gently little maidenmany thanks for your kindness and our queen bids us ask if you willgo with us to fairyland and learn what we can teach you</s>
gladly would i go with you dear fairies said eva but i cannotsail in your little boat</s>  see</s>  i can hold you in my hand and couldnot live among you without harming your tiny kingdom i am so large</s> then the elves laughed gayly as they folded their arms about hersaying you are a good child dear eva to fear doing harm to thoseweaker than yourself</s>  you cannot hurt us now</s>  look in the waterand see what we have done</s> eva looked into the brook and saw a tiny child standing betweenthe elves</s>  now i can go with you said she but see i canno longer step from the bank to yonder stone for the brook seems nowlike a great river and you have not given me wings like yours</s> but the fairies took each a hand and flew lightly over the stream</s> the queen and her subjects came to meet her and all seemed glad tosay some kindly word of welcome to the little stranger</s>  they placeda flowercrown upon her head laid their soft faces against her ownand soon it seemed as if the gentle elves had always been her friends</s> now must we go home said the queen and you shall go with uslittle one</s>

cheerful place they went where were many groups offlowers among whose leaves sat the child elves and learned fromtheir flowerbooks all that fairy hands had written there</s>  somestudied how to watch the tender buds when to spread them to thesunlight and when to shelter them from rain how to guard theripening seeds and when to lay them in the warm earth or send themon the summer wind to far off

hastened with littleroseleaf to the gates</s>  here she saw many bands of fairies folded indark mantles that mortals might not know them who with the childamong them flew away over hill and valley</s>  some went to the cottagesamid the hills some to the seaside to watch above the humble fisherfolks but little roseleaf and many others went into the noisy city</s> eva wondered within herself what

nothing but a little song i heard the harebells singing repliedthe fairy and taking her harp sang in a low sweet voicethe flowers lesson</s>  there grew a fragrant rosetree where the brook flows with two little tender buds and one full rose when the sun went down to his bed in the west the little buds leaned on the rosemothers breast while the bright eyed stars their long watch kept and the flowers of the valley in their green cradles slept then silently in odors they communed with each other the two little buds on the bosom of their mother</s>  o sister said the little one as she gazed at the sky i wish that the dew elves as they wander lightly by would bring me a star for they never grow dim and the father does not need them to burn round him</s>  the shining drops of dew the elves bring each day and place in my bosom so soon pass away but a star would glitter brightly through the long summer hours and i should be fairer than all my sister flowers</s>
 i would be fair and stately with a bright star to shine and give a queenly air to this crimson robe of mine</s>  and proudly she cried these fireflies shall be my jewels since the stars can never come to me</s>  just then a tiny dewdrop that hung oer the dell on the breast of the bud like a soft star fell but impatiently she flung it away from her leaf and it fell on her mother like a tear of grief while she folded to her breast with wilful pride a glittering firefly that hung by her side</s>  heed said the mother rose daughter mine why shouldst thou seek for beauty not thine</s>  the father hath made thee what thou now art and what he most loveth is a sweet pure heart</s>  then why dost thou take with such discontent the loving gift which he to thee hath sent</s>  for the cool fresh dew will render thee far more lovely and sweet than the brightest star they were made for heaven and can never come to shine like the firefly thou hast in that foolish breast of thine</s>  o my foolish little bud do listen to thy mother care only for true beauty and seek for no other</s>  there will be grief and trouble in that wilful little heart unfold thy leaves my daughter and let the fly depart</s>  but the proud little bud would have her own will and folded the firefly more closely still till the struggling insect tore open the vest of purple and green that covered her breast</s>  when the sun came up she saw with grief the blooming of her sister bud leaf by leaf</s>  while she once as fair and bright as the rest hung her weary head down on her wounded breast</s>  bright grew the sunshine and the soft summer air was filled with the music of flowers singing there but faint grew the little bud with thirst and pain and longed for the cool dew but now t was in vain</s>  then bitterly she wept for her folly and pride as drooping she stood by her fair sisters side</s>  then the rose mother leaned the weary little head on her bosom to rest and tenderly she said thou hast learned my little bud that whatever may betide thou canst win thyself no joy by passion or by pride</s>  the loving father sends the sunshine and the shower that thou mayst become a perfect little flower the sweet dews to feed thee the soft wind to cheer and the earth as a pleasant home while thou art dwelling here</s>  then shouldst thou not be grateful for all this kindly care and strive to keep thyself most innocent and fair</s>  then seek my little blossom to win humility be fair without be pure within and thou wilt happy be</s>  so when the quiet autumn of thy fragrant life shall come thou mayst pass away to bloom in the flower spirits home</s>  then from the mothers breast where it still lay hid into the fading bud the dewdrop gently slid stronger grew the little form and happy tears fell as the dew did its silent work and the bud grew well while the gentle rose leaned with motherly pride oer the fair little ones that bloomed at her side</s>  night came again and the fireflies flew but the bud let them pass and drank of the dew while the soft stars shone from the still summer heaven on the happy little flower that had learned the lesson given</s> the musicloving elves clapped their hands as startwinkle ceasedand the queen placed a flower crown with a gentle smile upon thefairys head sayingthe little buds lesson shall teach us how sad a thing is prideand that humility alone can bring true happiness to flower and fairy</s> you shall come next zephyr</s> and the little fairy who lay rocking to and fro upon a flutteringvineleaf thus began her storyas i lay resting in the bosom of a cowslip that bent above the brooka little wind tired of play told me this tale oflilybell and thistledown</s> once upon a time two little fairies went out into the world toseek their fortune</s>  thistledown was as gay and gallant a little elfas ever spread a wing</s>  his purple mantle and doublet of green wereembroidered with the brightest threads and the plume in his capcame always from the wing of the gayest butterfly</s> but he was not loved in fairyland for like the flower whosename and colors he wore though fair to look upon many were thelittle thorns of cruelty and selfishness that lay concealed by hisgay mantle</s>  many a gentle flower and harmless bird died by his handfor he cared for himself alone and whatever gave him pleasure mustbe his though happy hearts were rendered sad and peaceful homesdestroyed</s> such was thistledown but far different was his little friendlilybell</s>  kind compassionate and loving wherever her gentle facewas seen joy and gratitude were found no suffering flower or insectthat did not love and bless the kindly fairy and thus all elflandlooked upon her as a friend</s> nor did this make her vain and heedless of others she humbly dweltamong them seeking to do all the good she might and many a houselessbird and hungry insect that thistledown had harmed did she feed andshelter and in return no evil could befall her for so manyfriends were all about her seeking to repay her tenderness and loveby their watchful care</s> she would not now have left fairyland but to help and counsel herwild companion thistledown who discontented with his quiet homewould seek his fortune in the great world and she feared he wouldsuffer from his own faults for others would not always be as gentleand forgiving as his kindred</s>  so the kind little fairy left her homeand friends to go with him and thus side by side they flew beneaththe bright summer sky</s> on and on over hill and valley they went chasing the gaybutterflies or listening to the bees as they flew from flower toflower like busy little housewives singing as they worked tillat last they reached a pleasant garden filled with flowers and greenold trees</s> see cried thistledown what a lovely home is here let us restamong the cool leaves and hear the flowers sing for i am sadly tiredand hungry</s> so into the quiet garden they went and the winds gayly welcomed themwhile the flowers nodded on their stems offering their bright leavesfor the elves to rest upon and fresh sweet honey to refresh them</s> now dear thistle do not harm these friendly blossoms saidlilybell see how kindly they spread their leaves and offer ustheir dew</s>  it would be very wrong in you to repay their care withcruelty and pain</s>  you will be tender for my sake dear thistle</s> then she went among the flowers and they bent lovingly before herand laid their soft leaves against her little face that she might seehow glad they were to welcome one so good and gentle and kindlyoffered their dew and honey to the weary little fairy who sat amongtheir fragrant petals and looked smilingly on the happy blossoms whowith their soft low voices sang her to sleep</s> while lilybell lay dreaming among the roseleaves thistledown wentwandering through the garden</s>  first he robbed the bees of theirhoney and rudely shook the little flowers that he might get the dewthey had gathered to bathe their buds in</s>  then he chased the brightwinged flies and wounded them with the sharp thorn he carried for asword he broke the spiders shining webs lamed the birds and soonwherever he passed lay wounded insects and drooping flowers whilethe winds carried the tidings over the garden and bird and blossomlooked upon him as an evil spirit and fled away or closed theirleaves lest he should harm them</s> thus he went leaving sorrow and pain behind him till he came to theroses where lilybell lay sleeping</s>  there weary of his cruel sporthe stayed to rest beneath a graceful rosetree where grew oneblooming flower and a tiny bud</s> why are you so slow in blooming little one</s>  you are too old to berocked in your green cradle longer and should be out among yoursister flowers said thistle as he lay idly in the shadow of thetree</s> my little bud is not yet strong enough to venture forth replied therose as she bent fondly over it the sunlight and the rain wouldblight her tender form were she to blossom now but soon she will befit to bear them till then she is content to rest beside her motherand to wait</s> you silly flower said thistledown see how quickly i will make youbloom</s>  your waiting is all useless</s>  and speaking thus he pulledrudely apart the folded leaves and laid them open to the sun and airwhile the rose mother implored the cruel fairy to leave her little buduntouched</s> it is my first my only one said she and i have watched over itwith such care hoping it would soon bloom beside me and now you havedestroyed it</s>  how could you harm the little helpless one that neverdid aught to injure you</s>  and while her tears fell like summer rainshe drooped in grief above the little bud and sadly watched it fadingin the sunlight but thistledown heedless of the sorrow he had givenspread his wings and flew away</s> soon the sky grew dark and heavy drops began to fall</s>  then thistlehastened to the lily for her cup was deep and the white leavesfell like curtains over the fragrant bed he was a dainty little elfand could not sleep among the clovers and bright buttercups</s>  butwhen he asked the flower to unfold her leaves and take him in sheturned her pale soft face away and answered sadly i must shield mylittle drooping sisters whom you have harmed and cannot let you in</s> then thistledown was very angry and turned to find shelter among thestately roses but they showed their sharp thorns and while theirrosy faces glowed with anger told him to begone or they would repayhim for the wrong he had done their gentle kindred</s> he would have stayed to harm them but the rain fell fast and hehurried away saying the tulips will take me in for i have praisedtheir beauty and they are vain and foolish flowers</s> but when he came all wet and cold praying for shelter among theirthick leaves they only laughed and said scornfully we know youand will not let you in for you are false and cruel and willonly bring us sorrow</s>  you need not come to us for another mantlewhen the rain has spoilt your fine one and do not stay here orwe will do you harm</s> then they waved their broad leaves stormily and scattered the heavydrops on his dripping garments</s> now must i go to the humble daisies and blue violets said thistlethey will be glad to let in so fine a fairy and i shall die inthis cold wind and rain</s> so away he flew as fast as his heavy wings would bear him to thedaisies but they nodded their heads wisely and closed their leavesyet closer saying sharplygo away with yourself and do not imagine we will open our leavesto you and spoil our seeds by letting in the rain</s>  it serves yourightly to gain our love and confidence and repay it by suchcruelty</s>  you will find no shelter here for one whose careless handwounded our little friend violet and broke the truest heart that everbeat in a flowers breast</s>  we are very angry with you wicked fairygo away and hide yourself</s> ah cried the shivering elf where can i find shelter</s>  i will goto the violets they will forgive and take me in</s> but the daisies had spoken truly the gentle little flower was deadand her blueeyed sisters were weeping bitterly over her faded leaves</s> now i have no friends sighed poor thistledown and must die ofcold</s>  ah if i had but minded lilybell i might now be dreamingbeneath some flowers leaves</s> others can forgive and love beside lilybell and violet saida faint sweet voice i have no little bud to shelter now and youcan enter here</s>  it was the rose mother that spoke and thistle sawhow pale the bright leaves had grown and how the slender stem wasbowed</s>  grieved ashamed and wondering at the flowers forgivingwords he laid his weary head on the bosom he had filled with sorrowand the fragrant leaves were folded carefully about him</s> but he could find no rest</s>  the rose strove to comfort him but whenshe fancied he was sleeping thoughts of her lost bud stole in andthe little heart beat so sadly where he lay that no sleep came whilethe bitter tears he had caused to flow fell more coldly on him thanthe rain without</s>  then he heard the other flowers whispering amongthemselves of his cruelty and the sorrow he had brought to theirhappy home and many wondered how the rose who had suffered mostcould yet forgive and shelter him</s> never could i forgive one who had robbed me of my children</s>  i couldbow my head and die but could give no happiness to one who had takenall my own said hyacinth bending fondly over the little ones thatblossomed by her side</s> dear violet is not the only one who will leave us sobbed littlemignonette the rose mother will fade like her little bud and weshall lose our gentlest teacher</s>  her last lesson is forgivenesslet us show our love for her and the gentle stranger lilybellby allowing no unkind word or thought of him who has brought us allthis grief</s>
soon the sunlight came again and with it lilybell seeking forthistledown but he was ashamed and stole away</s> when the flowers told their sorrow to kindhearted lilybell she weptbitterly at the pain her friend had given and with loving wordsstrove to comfort those whom he had grieved with gentle care shehealed the wounded birds and watched above the flowers he had harmedbringing each day dew and sunlight to refresh and strengthen till allwere well again and though sorrowing for their dead friends stillthey forgave thistle for the sake of her who had done so much forthem</s>  thus erelong buds fairer than that she had lost lay on therose mothers breast and for all she had suffered she was well repaidby the love of lilybell and her sister flowers</s> and when bird bee and blossom were strong and fair again the gentlefairy said farewell and flew away to seek her friend leaving behindmany grateful hearts who owed their joy and life to her</s> meanwhile over hill and dale went thistledown and for a time waskind and gentle to every living thing</s>  he missed sadly the littlefriend who had left her happy home to watch over him but he wastoo proud to own his fault and so went on hoping she would find him</s> one day he fell asleep and when he woke the sun had set and the dewbegan to fall the flowercups were closed and he had nowhere to gotill a friendly little bee belated by his heavy load of honey bidthe weary fairy come with him</s> help me to bear my honey home and you can stay with us tonighthe kindly said</s> so thistle gladly went with him and soon they came to a pleasantgarden where among the fairest flowers stood the hive covered withvines and overhung with blossoming trees</s>  glowworms stood at thedoor to light them home and as they passed in the fairy thought howcharming it must be to dwell in such a lovely place</s>  the floor of waxwas pure and white as marble while the walls were formed of goldenhoneycomb and the air was fragrant with the breath of flowers</s> you cannot see our queen tonight said the little bee buti will show you to a bed where you can rest</s> and he led the tired fairy to a little cell where on a bed offlowerleaves he folded his wings and fell asleep</s> as the first ray of sunlight stole in he was awakened by sweet music</s> it was the morning song of the bees</s>  awake</s>  awake</s>  for the earliest gleam  of golden sunlight shines on the rippling waves that brightly flow  beneath the flowering vines</s>  awake</s>  awake</s>  for the low sweet chant  of the wildbirds morning hymn comes floating by on the fragrant air  through the forest cool and dim  then spread each wing  and work and sing through the long bright sunny hours  oer the pleasant earth  we journey forth for a day among the flowers</s>  awake</s>  awake</s>  for the summer wind  hath bidden the blossoms unclose hath opened the violets soft blue eye  and wakened the sleeping rose</s>  and lightly they wave on their slender stems  fragrant and fresh and fair waiting for us as we singing come  to gather our honeydew there</s>   then spread each wing  and work and sing through the long bright sunny hours  oer the pleasant earth  we journey forth for a day among the flowers</s> soon his friend came to bid him rise as the queen desired to speakwith him</s>  so with his purple mantle thrown gracefully over hisshoulder and his little cap held respectfully in his hand hefollowed nimblewing to the great hall where the queen was beingserved by her little pages</s>  some bore her fresh dew and honey somefanned her with fragrant flowerleaves while others scattered thesweetest perfumes on the air</s> little fairy said the queen you are welcome to my palace andwe will gladly have you stay with us if you will obey our laws</s> we do not spend the pleasant summer days in idleness and pleasure buteach one labors for the happiness and good of all</s>  if our home isbeautiful we have made it so by industry and here as one largeloving family we dwell no sorrow care or discord can enter inwhile all obey the voice of her who seeks to be a wise and gentlequeen to them</s>  if you will stay with us we will teach you

us food it were most cruel to treat them with aughtsave gentleness and gratitude</s>  now will you stay with us and learnwhat even mortals seek to know that labor brings true happiness</s> and thistle said he would stay and dwell with them for he was tiredof wandering alone and thought he might live here till lilybellshould come or till he was weary of the kindhearted bees</s>  then theytook away his gay garments and dressed him like themselves in theblack velvet cloak with golden bands across his breast</s> now come with us they said</s>
 so forth into the green fieldsthey went and made their breakfast among the dewy flowers and thentill the sun set they flew from bud to blossom singing as they wentand thistle for a while was happier than when breaking flowers andharming gentle birds</s> but he soon grew tired of working all day in the sun and longed to befree again</s>
 he could find no pleasure with the industrious bees andsighed to be away with his idle friends the butterflies so while theothers worked he slept or played and then in haste to get his sharehe tore the flowers and took all they had saved for their own food</s> nor was this all he told such pleasant tales of the life he ledbefore he came to live with them that many grew unhappy anddiscontented and they who had before wished no greater joy thanthe love and praise of their kind queen now disobeyed and blamed herfor all she had done for them</s> long she bore with their unkind words and deeds and when at lengthshe found it was the ungrateful fairy who had wrought this trouble inher quiet kingdom she strove with sweet forgiving words to showhim all the wrong he had done but he would not listen and still wenton destroying the happiness of those who had done so much for him</s> then when she saw that no kindness could touch his heart she saidthistledown we took you in a friendless stranger fed and clothedyou and made our home as pleasant to you as we could and in returnfor all our care you have brought discontent and trouble to mysubjects grief and care to me</s>  i cannot let my peaceful kingdombe disturbed by you therefore go and seek another home</s>  you may findother friends but none will love you more than we had you beenworthy of it so farewell</s>  and the doors of the once happy homehe had disturbed were closed behind him</s> then he was very angry and determined to bring some great sorrow onthe good queen</s>  so he sought out the idle wilful bees whom he hadfirst made discontented bidding them follow him and win the honeythe queen had stored up for the winter</s> let us feast and make merry in the pleasant summertime saidthistle winter is far off why should we waste these lovely daystoiling to lay up the food we might enjoy now</s>  come we will takewhat we have made and think no more of what the queen has said</s> so while the industrious bees were out among the flowers he ledthe drones to the hive and took possession of the honey destroyingand laying waste the home of the kind bees then fearing thatin their grief and anger they might harm him thistle flew away toseek new friends</s> after many wanderings he came at length to a great forest and herebeside a still lake he stayed to rest</s>  delicate woodflowers grew nearhim in the deep green moss with drooping heads as if they listenedto the soft wind singing among the pines</s>  brighteyed birds peepedat him from their nests and manycolored insects danced above thecool still lake</s> this is a pleasant place said thistle it shall be my home for awhile</s>  come hither blue dragonfly i would gladly make a friend ofyou for i am all alone</s> the dragonfly folded his shining wings beside the elf listened tothe tale he told promised to befriend the lonely one and stroveto make the forest a happy home to him</s> so here dwelt thistle and many kind friends gathered round himfor he spoke gently to them and they knew nothing of the cruel deedshe had done and for a while he was happy and content</s>  but at lengthhe grew weary of the gentle birds and wildflowers and sought newpleasure in destroying the beauty he was tired of and soon thefriends who had so kindly welcomed him looked upon him as an evilspirit and shrunk away as he approached</s> at length his friend the dragonfly besought him to leave the quiethome he had disturbed</s>  then thistle was very angry and while thedragonfly was sleeping among the flowers that hung over the lake heled an ugly spider to the spot and bade him weave his nets about thesleeping insect and bind him fast</s>  the cruel spider gladly obeyedthe ungrateful fairy and soon the poor fly could move neither leg norwing</s>  then thistle flew away through the wood leaving sorrow andtrouble behind him</s> he had not journeyed far before he grew weary and lay down to rest</s> long he slept and when he awoke and tried to rise his hands andwings were bound while beside him stood two strange little figureswith dark faces and garments that rustled like withered leaves whocried to him as he struggled to get freelie still you naughty fairy you are in the brownies power andshall be well punished for your cruelty ere we let you go</s> so poor thistle lay sorrowfully wondering what would come of itand wishing lilybell would come to help and comfort him but he hadleft her and she could not help him now</s> soon a troop of brownies came rustling through the air and gatheredround him while one who wore an acorncup on his head and was theirking said as he stood beside the trembling fairyyou have done many cruel things and caused much sorrow to happyhearts now you are in my power and i shall keep you prisonertill you have repented</s>  you cannot dwell on the earth without harmingthe fair things given you to enjoy so you shall live alone insolitude and darkness till you have learned to find happiness ingentle deeds and forget yourself in giving joy to others</s>  when youhave learned this i will set you free</s> then the brownies bore him to a high dark rock and entering alittle door led him to a small cell dimly lighted by a crevicethrough which came a single gleam of sunlight and there throughlong long days poor thistle sat alone and gazed with wistful eyesat the little opening longing to be out on the green earth</s>  no onecame to him but the silent brownies who brought his daily food andwith bitter tears he wept for lilybell mourning his cruelty andselfishness seeking to do some kindly deed that might atone for hiswrongdoing</s> a little vine that grew outside his prison rock came creeping upand looked in through the crevice as if to cheer the lonely fairywho welcomed it most gladly and daily sprinkled its soft leaveswith his small share of water that the little vine might liveeven if it darkened more and more his dim cell</s> the watchful brownies saw this kind deed and brought him freshflowers and many things which thistle gratefully received thoughhe never knew it was his kindness to the vine that gained for himthese pleasures</s> thus did poor thistle strive to be more gentle and unselfish andgrew daily happier and better</s> now while thistledown was a captive in the lonely cell lilybell wasseeking him far and wide and sadly traced him by the sorrowing heartshe had left behind</s> she healed the drooping flowers cheered the queen bees griefbrought back her discontented subjects restored the home to peaceand order and left them blessing her</s> thus she journeyed on till she reached the forest where thistledownhad lost his freedom</s>  she unbound the starving dragonfly and tendedthe wounded birds but though all learned to love her none could tellwhere the brownies had borne her friend till a little wind camewhispering by and told her that a sweet voice had been heard singingfairy songs deep in a mossgrown rock</s> then lilybell went seeking through the forest listening for thevoice</s>
 but deep in the dark cold rock sadly i dwell longing for thee dear friend lilybell</s>  lilybell</s> thistle dear thistle where are you</s>  joyfully cried lilybellas she flew from rock to rock</s>  but the voice was still and shewould have looked in vain had she not seen a little vine whose greenleaves fluttering to and fro seemed beckoning her to come and as shestood among its flowers she sang through sunlight and summer air i have sought for thee long guided by birds and flowers and now by thy song</s>  thistledown</s>  thistledown</s>  oer hill and dell hither to comfort thee comes lilybell</s> then from the vineleaves two little arms were stretched out to herand thistledown was found</s>  so lilybell made her home in the shadowof the vine and brought such joy to thistle that his lonely cellseemed pleasanter to him than all the world beside and he grew dailymore like his gentle friend</s>  but it did not last long for one dayshe did not come</s>  he watched and waited long for the little facethat used to peep smiling in through the vineleaves</s>  he called andbeckoned through the narrow opening but no lilybell answered andhe wept sadly as he thought of all she had done for him and that nowhe could not go to seek and help her for he had lost his freedomby his own cruel and wicked deeds</s> at last he besought the silent brownie earnestly to tell himwhither she had gone</s> o let me go to her prayed thistle if she is in sorrow i willcomfort her and show my gratitude for all she has done for me dearbrownie set me free and when she is found i will come and be yourprisoner again</s>  i will bear and suffer any danger for her sake</s> lilybell is safe replied the brownie come you shall learnthe trial that awaits you</s> then he led the wondering fairy from his prison to a group of talldrooping ferns beneath whose shade a large white lily had beenplaced forming a little tent within which on a couch of thick greenmoss lay lilybell in a deep sleep the sunlight stole softly inand all was cool and still</s> you cannot wake her said the brownie as thistle folded his armstenderly about her</s>  it is a magic slumber and she will not waketill you shall bring hither gifts from the earth air and waterspirits</s>  t is a long and weary task for you have made no friendsto help you and will have to seek for them alone</s>  this is the trialwe shall give you and if your love for lilybell be strong enoughto keep you from all cruelty and selfishness and make you kind andloving as you should be she will awake to welcome you and love youstill more fondly than before</s> then thistle with a last look on the little friend he loved so wellset forth alone to his long task</s> the home of the earth spirits was the first to find and no onewould tell him where to look</s>  so far and wide he wandered throughgloomy forests and among lonely hills with none to cheer him whensad and weary none to guide him on his way</s> on he went thinking of lilybell and for her sake bearing allfor in his quiet prison many gentle feelings and kindly thoughts hadsprung up in his heart and he now strove to be friends with all andwin for himself the love and confidence of those whom once he soughtto harm and cruelly destroy</s> but few believed him for they remembered his false promises andevil deeds and would not trust him now so poor thistle found fewto love or care for him</s> long he wandered and carefully he sought but could not find theearth spirits home</s>  and when at length he reached the pleasantgarden where he and lilybell first parted he said within himselfhere i will stay awhile and try to win by kindly deeds the flowersforgiveness for the pain and sorrow i brought them long ago and theymay learn to love and trust me</s>  so even if i never find the spiritsi shall be worthier of lilybells affection if i strive to atone forthe wrong i have done</s> then he went among the flowers but they closed their leaves andshrank away trembling with fear while the birds fled to hideamong the leaves as he passed</s> this grieved poor thistle and he longed to tell them how changedhe had become but they would not listen</s>  so he tried to show byquiet deeds of kindness that he meant no harm to them and soonthe kindhearted birds pitied the lonely fairy and when he came nearsang cheering songs and dropped ripe berries in his path for heno longer broke their eggs or hurt their little ones</s> and when the flowers saw this and found the once cruel elf nowwatering and tending little buds feeding hungry insects andhelping the busy ants to bear their heavy loads they shared the pityof the birds and longed to trust him but they dared not yet</s> he came one day while wandering through the garden to the littlerose he had once harmed so sadly</s>  many buds now bloomed beside herand her soft face glowed with motherly pride as she bent fondly overthem</s>  but when thistle came he saw with sorrow how she bade themclose their green curtains and conceal themselves beneath the leavesfor there was danger near and drooping still more closely over themshe seemed to wait with trembling fear the cruel fairys coming</s> but no rude hand tore her little ones away no unkind words werespoken but a soft shower of dew fell lightly on them and thistlebending tenderly above them saiddear flower forgive the sorrow i once brought you and trust me nowfor lilybells sake</s>  her gentleness has changed my cruelty tokindness and i would gladly repay all for the harm i have donebut none will love and trust me now</s> then the little rose looked up and while the dewdrops shonelike happy tears upon her leaves she saidi will love and trust you thistle for you are indeed muchchanged</s>  make your home among us and my sister flowers will soonlearn to love you as you deserve</s>  not for sweet lilybells sakebut for your own will i become your friend for you are kind andgentle now and worthy of our love</s>  look up my little ones there isno danger near look up and welcome thistle to our home</s> then the little buds raised their rosy faces danced again upontheir stems and nodded kindly at thistle who smiled on them throughhappy tears and kissed the sweet forgiving rose who loved andtrusted him when most forlorn and friendless</s> but the other flowers wondered among themselves and hyacinth saidif roseleaf is his friend surely we may be yet still i fear he maysoon grow weary of this gentleness and be again the wicked fairy heonce was and we shall suffer for our kindness to him now</s> ah do not doubt him</s>  cried warmhearted little mignonette surelysome good spirit has changed the wicked thistle into this good littleelf</s>  see how tenderly he lifts aside the leaves that overshadow paleharebell and listen now how softly he sings as he rocks littleeglantine to sleep</s>  he has done many friendly things though nonesave roseleaf has been kind to him and he is very sad</s>  last nightwhen i awoke to draw my curtains closer he sat weeping in themoonlight so bitterly i longed to speak a kindly word to him</s> dear sisters let us trust him</s> and they all said little mignonette was right and spreading widetheir leaves they bade him come and drink their dew and lie amongthe fragrant petals striving to cheer his sorrow</s>  thistle told themall and after much whispering together they saidyes we will help you to find the earth spirits for you are strivingto be good and for love of lilybell we will do much for you</s> so they called a little brighteyed mole and said downybackwe have given you a pleasant home among our roots and you area grateful little friend so will you guide dear thistle to theearth spirits home</s> downyback said yes and thistle thanking the kindly flowersfollowed his little guide through long dark galleries deeperand deeper into the ground while a glowworm flew before to lightthe way</s>  on they went and after a while reached a path lit up bybright jewels hung upon the walls</s>  here downyback and glimmerthe glowworm left him sayingwe can lead you no farther you must now go on alone and the musicof the spirits will guide you to their home</s> then they went quickly up the winding path and thistle guidedby the sweet music went on alone</s> he soon reached a lovely spot whose golden halls were brightwith jewels which sparkled brightly and threw manycolored shadowson the shining garments of the little spirits who danced belowto the melody of soft silvery bells</s> long thistle stood watching the brilliant forms that flashed andsparkled round him but he missed the flowers and the sunlightand rejoiced that he was not an earth spirit</s> at last they spied him out and gladly welcoming him bade him joinin their dance</s>  but thistledown was too sad for that and when hetold them all his story they no longer urged but sought to comforthim and one whom they called little sparkle for her crown and robeshone with the brightest diamonds said you will have to workfor us ere you can win a gift to show the brownies do you seethose golden bells that make such music as we wave them to and fro</s> we worked long and hard ere they were won and you can win one ofthose if you will do the task we give you</s> and thistle said no task will be too hard for me to do for dearlilybells sake</s> then they led him to a strange dark place lit up with torcheswhere troops of spirits flew busily to and fro among damp rocks andthrough dark galleries that led far down into the earth</s>  what dothey here</s>  asked thistle</s> i will tell replied little sparkle for i once worked heremyself</s>  some of them watch above the flowerroots and keep themfresh and strong others gather the clear drops that trickle from thedamp rocks and form a little spring which growing ever largerrises to the light above and gushes forth in some green field orlonely forest where the wildbirds come to drink and woodflowersspread their thirsty leaves above the clear cool waves as they godancing away carrying joy and freshness wherever they go</s>  othersshape the bright jewels into lovely forms and make the goodluckpennies which we give to mortals whom we love</s>  and here you must toiltill the golden flower is won</s> then thistle went among the spirits and joined in their taskshe tended the flowerroots gathered the waterdrops and formed thegoodluck pennies</s>  long and hard he worked and was often sad andweary often tempted by unkind and selfish thoughts but he thoughtof lilybell and strove to be kind and loving as she had been andsoon the spirits learned to love the patient fairy who had left hishome to toil among them for the sake of his gentle friend</s> at length came little sparkle to him saying you have done enoughcome now and dance and feast with us for the golden flower is won</s> but thistle could not stay for half his task was not yet done andhe longed for sunlight and lilybell</s>  so taking a kind farewellhe hastened through the torchlit path up to the light again andspreading his wings flew over hill and dale till he reached theforest where lilybell lay sleeping</s> it was early morning and the rosy light shone brightly through thelilyleaves upon her as thistle entered and laid his first giftat the brownie kings feet</s> you have done well said he we hear good tidings of you frombird and flower and you are truly seeking to repair the evilyou have done</s>  take now one look at your little friend and thengo forth to seek from the air spirits your second gift</s> then thistle said farewell again to lilybell and flew far and wideamong the clouds seeking the air spirits but though he wandered tillhis weary wings could bear him no longer it was in vain</s>  so faintand sad he lay down to rest on a broad vineleaf that flutteredgently in the wind and as he lay he saw beneath him the homeof the kind bees whom he had so disturbed and lilybell had helpedand comforted</s> i will seek to win their pardon and show them that i am no longerthe cruel fairy who so harmed them thought thistle and when theybecome again my friends i will ask their help to find the airspirits and if i deserve it they will gladly aid me on my way</s> so he flew down into the field below and hastened busily fromflower to flower till he had filled a tiny bluebell with sweetfresh honey</s>  then he stole softly to the hive and placing it nearthe door concealed himself to watch</s>  soon his friend nimblewingcame flying home and when he spied the little cup he hummed withjoy and called his companions around him</s> surely some good elf has placed it here for us said they let usbear it to our queen it is so fresh and fragrant it will be a fitgift for her and they joyfully took it in little dreaming who hadplaced it there</s> so each day thistle filled a flowercup and laid it at the doorand each day the bees wondered more and more for many strange thingshappened</s>  the fieldflowers told of the good spirit who watchedabove them and the birds sang of the same kind little elf bringingsoft moss for their nests and food for their hungry young oneswhile all around the hive had grown fairer since the fairy came</s> but the bees never saw him for he feared he had not yet done enoughto win their forgiveness and friendship so he lived alone among thevines daily bringing them honey and doing some kindly action</s> at length as he lay sleeping in a flowerbell a little bee camewandering by and knew him for the wicked thistle so he called hisfriends and as they flew murmuring around him he awoke</s> what shall we do to you naughty elf</s>  said they</s>  you are inour power and we will sting you if you are not still</s> let us close the flowerleaves around him and leave him hereto starve cried one who had not yet forgotten all the sorrowthistle had caused them long ago</s> no no that were very cruel dear buzz said little hum let ustake him to our queen and she will tell us how to show our anger forthe wicked deeds he did</s>  see how bitterly he weeps be kind to himhe will not harm us more</s> you good little hum</s>  cried a kindhearted robin who had hopped nearto listen to the bees</s>  dear friends do you not know that this isthe good fairy who has dwelt so quietly among us watching over birdand blossom giving joy to all he helps</s>  it is he who brings thehoneycup each day to you and then goes silently away that you maynever know who works so faithfully for you</s>  be kind to him for ifhe has done wrong he has repented of it as you may see</s> can this be naughty thistle</s>  said nimblewing</s> yes it is i said thistle but no longer cruel and unkind</s>  i havetried to win your love by patient industry</s>  ah trust me now and youshall see i am not naughty thistle any more</s> then the wondering bees led him to their queen and when he had toldhis tale and begged their forgiveness it was gladly given andall strove to show him that he was loved and trusted</s>  then he askedif they could tell him where the air spirits dwelt for he must notforget dear lilybell and to his great joy the queen said yesand bade little hum guide thistle to cloudland</s> little hum joyfully obeyed and thistle followed him as he flewhigher and higher among the soft clouds till in the distance they sawa radiant light</s> there is their home and i must leave you now dear thistle saidthe little bee and bidding him farewell he flew singing back whilethistle following the light soon found himself in the air spiritshome</s>
the sky was gold and purple like an autumn sunset and long walls ofbrilliant clouds lay round him</s>  a rosy light shone through the silvermist on gleaming columns and the rainbow roof soft fragrant windswent whispering by and airy little forms were flitting to and fro</s> long thistle wondered at the beauty round him and then he wentamong the shining spirits told his tale and asked a gift</s>
but they answered like the earth spirits</s>  you must serve us firstand then we will gladly give you a robe of sunlight like our own</s> and then they told him how they wafted flowerseeds over the earthto beautify and brighten lonely spots how they watched above theblossoms by day and scattered dews at night brought sunlightinto darkened places and soft winds to refresh and cheer</s> these are the things we do said they and you must aid usfor a time</s> and thistle gladly went with the lovely spirits by day he joinedthe sunlight and the breeze in their silent work by night withstarlight and her sister spirits he flew over the moonlit earthdropping cool dew upon the folded flowers and bringing happy dreamsto sleeping mortals</s>  many a kind deed was done many a gentle wordwas spoken and each day lighter grew his heart and stronger hispower of giving joy to others</s> at length starlight bade him work no more and gladly gave himthe gift he had won</s>  then his second task was done and he flew gaylyback to the green earth and slumbering lilybell</s> the silvery moonlight shone upon her as he came to give his secondgift and the brownie spoke more kindly than before</s> one more trial thistle and she will awake</s>  go bravely forth andwin your last and hardest gift</s> then with a light heart thistle journeyed away to the brooks andrivers seeking the water spirits</s>  but he looked in vain tillwandering through the forest where the brownies took him captivehe stopped beside the quiet lake</s> as he stood here he heard a sound of pain and looking in the tallgrass at his side he saw the dragonfly whose kindness he oncerepayed by pain and sorrow and who now lay suffering and alone</s> thistle bent tenderly beside him saying dear flutter do notfear me</s>  i will gladly ease your pain if you will let me i am yourfriend and long to show you how i grieve for all the wrong i did youwhen you were so kind to me</s>  forgive and let me help and comfortyou</s> then he bound up the broken wing and spoke so tenderly that flutterdoubted him no longer and was his friend again</s> day by day did thistle watch beside him making little beds ofcool fresh moss for him to rest upon fanning him when he sleptand singing sweet songs to cheer him when awake</s>  and often whenpoor flutter longed to be dancing once again over the blue wavesthe fairy bore him in his arms to the lake and on a broad leafwith a green flag for a sail they floated on the still water whilethe dragonflys companions flew about them playing merry games</s> at length the broken wing was well and thistle said he must againseek the water spirits</s>  i can tell you where to find them saidflutter you must follow yonder little brook and it will lead youto the sea where the spirits dwell</s>  i would gladly do more for youdear thistle but i cannot for they live deep beneath the waves</s> you will find some kind friend to aid you on your way and sofarewell</s> thistle followed the little brook as it flowed through field andvalley growing ever larger till it reached the sea</s>  here the windblew freshly and the great waves rolled and broke at thistles feetas he stood upon the shore watching the billows dancing and sparklingin the sun</s> how shall i find the spirits in this great sea with none to help orguide me</s>  yet it is my last task and for lilybells sake i must notfear or falter now said thistle</s>  so he flew hither and thitherover the sea looking through the waves</s>  soon he saw far belowthe branches of the coral tree</s> they must be here thought he and folding his wings he plungedinto the deep cold sea</s>  but he saw only fearful monsters and darkshapes that gathered round him and trembling with fear he struggledup again</s> the great waves tossed him to and fro and cast him bruised and faintupon the shore</s>  here he lay weeping bitterly till a voice beside himsaid poor little elf what has befallen you</s>  these rough waves arenot fit playmates for so delicate a thing as you</s>  tell me yoursorrow and i will comfort you</s> and thistle looking up saw a white seabird at his side who triedwith friendly words to cheer him</s>  so he told all his wanderingsand how he sought the sea spirits</s> surely if bee and blossom do their part to help you birds shouldaid you too said the seabird</s>  i will call my friend thenautilus and he will bear you safely to the coral palace where thespirits dwell</s> so spreading his great wings he flew away and soon thistle sawa little boat come dancing over the waves and wait beside the shorefor him</s> in he sprang</s>  nautilus raised his little sail to the wind and thelight boat glided swiftly over the blue sea</s>  at last thistle criedi see lovely arches far below let me go it is the spirits home</s> nay close your eyes and trust to me</s>  i will bear you safely downsaid nautilus</s> so thistle closed his eyes and listened to the murmur of the seaas they sank slowly through the waves</s>  the soft sound lulled himto sleep and when he awoke the boat was gone and he stood amongthe water spirits in their strange and lovely home</s> lofty arches of snowwhite coral bent above him and the wallsof brightly tinted shells were wreathed with lovely seaflowers andthe sunlight shining on the waves cast silvery shadows on the groundwhere sparkling stones glowed in the sand</s>  a cool fresh wind sweptthrough the waving garlands of bright seamoss and the distant murmurof dashing waves came softly on the air</s>  soon troops of gracefulspirits flitted by and when they found the wondering elf theygathered round him bringing pearlshells heaped with precious stonesand all the rare strange gifts that lie beneath the sea</s>  but thistlewished for none of these and when his tale was told the kindlyspirits pitied him and little pearl sighed as she told him of thelong and weary task he must perform ere he could win a crown ofsnowwhite pearls like those they wore</s>  but thistle had gainedstrength and courage in his wanderings and did not falter now whenthey led him to a place among the coralworkers and told him he mustlabor here till the spreading branches reached the light and airthrough the waves that danced above</s> with a patient hope that he might yet be worthy of lilybellthe fairy left the lovely spirits and their pleasant home to toilamong the coralbuilders where all was strange and dim</s>  long longhe worked but still the waves rolled far above them and his task wasnot yet done and many bitter tears poor thistle shed and sadly hepined for air and sunlight the voice of birds and breath of flowers</s> often folded in the magic garments which the spirits gave him thathe might pass unharmed among the fearful creatures dwelling therehe rose to the surface of the sea and gliding through the wavesgazed longingly upon the hills now looking blue and dim so far awayor watched the flocks of summer birds journeying to a warmer landand they brought sad memories of green old forests and sunny fieldsto the lonely little fairy floating on the great wild sea</s> day after day went by and slowly thistles task drew towards an end</s> busily toiled the coralworkers but more busily toiled he insectand spirit daily wondered more and more at the industry and patienceof the silent little elf who had a friendly word for all thoughhe never joined them in their sport</s> higher and higher grew the coralboughs and lighter grew the fairysheart while thoughts of dear lilybell cheered him on as day by dayhe steadily toiled and when at length the sun shone on his workand it was done he stayed but to take the garland he had won andto thank the good spirits for their love and care</s>  then up throughthe cold blue waves he swiftly glided and shaking the bright dropsfrom his wings soared singing up to the sunny sky</s> on through the fragrant air went thistle looking with glad faceupon the fair fresh earth below where flowers looked smiling upand green trees bowed their graceful heads as if to welcome him</s>  soonthe forest where lilybell lay sleeping rose before him and as hepassed along the cool dim woodpaths never had they seemed so fair</s> but when he came where his little friend had slept it was no longerthe dark silent spot where he last saw her</s>  garlands hung from everytree and the fairest flowers filled the air with their sweet breath</s> birds gay voices echoed far and wide and the little brook wentsinging by beneath the arching ferns that bent above it greenleaves rustled in the summer wind and the air was full of music</s> but the fairest sight was lilybell as she lay on the couch ofvelvet moss that fairy hands had spread</s>  the golden flower laybeside her and the glittering robe was folded round her little form</s> the warmest sunlight fell upon her and the softest breezes liftedher shining hair</s> happy tears fell fast as thistle folded his arms around hercrying o lilybell dear lilybell awake</s>  i have been true to youand now my task is done</s> then with a smile lilybell awoke and looked with wondering eyesupon the beauty that had risen round her</s> dear thistle what mean these fair things and why are we in thislovely place</s> listen lilybell said the brownie king as he appeared beside her</s> and then he told all that thistle had done to show his love for herhow he had wandered far and wide to seek the fairy gifts and toiledlong and hard to win them how he had been loving true and tenderwhen most lonely and forsaken</s> bird bee and blossom have forgiven him and none is more lovedand trusted now by all than the once cruel thistle said the kingas he bent down to the happy elf who bowed low before him</s> you have learned the beauty of a gentle kindly heart dear thistleand you are now worthy to become the friend of her for whom you havedone so much</s>  place the crown upon her head for she is queen of allthe forest fairies now</s> and as the crown shone on the head that lilybell bent down onthistles breast the forest seemed alive with little forms whosprang from flower and leaf and gathered round her bringing giftsfor their new queen</s> if i am queen then you are king dear thistle said the fairy</s> take the crown and i will have a wreath of flowers</s>  you have toiledand suffered for my sake and you alone should rule over these littleelves whose love you have won</s> keep your crown lilybell for yonder come the spirits with theirgifts to thistle said the brownie</s>  and as he pointed with hiswand out from among the mossy roots of an old tree came troopingthe earth spirits their flowerbells ringing softly as they cameand their jewelled garments glittering in the sun</s>  on to wherethistledown stood beneath the shadow of the flowers with lilybellbeside him went the spirits and then forth sprang little sparklewaving a golden flower whose silvery music filled the air</s>  dearthistle said the shining spirit what you toiled so faithfullyto win for another let us offer now as a token of our love for you</s> as she ceased down through the air came floating bands of lovelyair spirits bringing a shining robe and they too told their lovefor the gentle fairy who had dwelt with them</s> then softly on the breeze came distant music growing ever nearertill over the rippling waves came the singing water spirits in theirboats of manycolored shells and as they placed their glitteringcrown on thistles head loud rang the flowers and joyously sangthe birds while all the forest fairies cried with silvery voiceslilybell and thistledown</s>  long live our king and queen</s> have you a tale for us too dear violeteye</s>  said the queen aszephyr ceased</s>  the little elf thus named looked from among theflowerleaves where she sat and with a smile replied as i wasweaving garlands in the field i heard a primrose tell this taleto her friend goldenrod</s> little bud</s> in a great forest high up among the green boughs lived birdbrownbreast and his brighteyed little mate</s>  they were now veryhappy their home was done the four blue eggs lay in the soft nestand the little wife sat still and patient on them while the husbandsang and told her charming tales and brought her sweet berriesand little worms</s> things went smoothly on till one day she found in the nest a littlewhite egg with a golden band about it</s> my friend cried she come and see</s>  where can this fine egg havecome from</s>  my four are here and this also what think you of it</s> the husband shook his head gravely and said be not alarmed mylove it is doubtless some good fairy who has given us this and weshall find some gift within do not let us touch it but do you sitcarefully upon it and we shall see in time what has been sent us</s> so they said nothing about it and soon their home had four littlechirping children and then the white egg opened and beholda little maiden lay singing within</s>  then how amazed were theyand how they welcomed her as she lay warm beneath the mothers wingand how the young birds did love her</s> great joy was in the forest and proud were the parents of theirfamily and still more of the little one who had come to themwhile all the neighbors flocked in to see dame brownbreastslittle child</s>  and the tiny maiden talked to them and sang somerrily that they could have listened for

greenleaves served her for little robes and thus she found garments inthe flowers of the field and a happy home with mother brownbreastand all in the wood from the stately trees to the little mossesin

they might hear the soft sounds stealing throughthe dim woodpaths and mortal children came to listen saying softlyhear the flowers sing and touch them not for the fairies are here</s>
then came a band of sad little elves to bud praying that they mighthear the sweet music and when she took them by the hand and spokegently to them they wept and said sadly when she asked them whencethey camewe dwelt once in fairyland and o how happy were we then</s>  but alas</s> we were not worthy of so fair a home and were sent forth into thecold world</s>  look at our robes they are like the withered leavesour wings are dim our crowns are gone and we lead sad lonely livesin this dark forest</s>  let us stay with you your gay music soundslike fairy songs and you have such a friendly way with you and speakso gently to us</s>  it is good to be near one so lovely and so kind andyou can tell us how we may again become fair and innocent</s>  say we maystay with you kind little maiden</s> and bud said yes and they stayed but her kind little heartwas grieved that they wept so sadly and all she could say could notmake them happy till at last she saiddo not weep and i will go to queen dewdrop and beseech herto let you come back</s>  i will tell her that you are repentantand will do anything to gain her love again that you are sad andlong to be forgiven</s>  this will i say and more and trust she willgrant my prayer</s> she will not say no to you dear bud said the poor little fairiesshe will love you as we do and if we can but come again to our losthome we cannot give you thanks enough</s>  go bud and if there bepower in fairy gifts you shall be as happy as our hearts best lovecan make you</s>
the tidings of buds departure flew through the forest and all herfriends came to say farewell as with the morning sun she would goand each brought some little gift for the land of fairies wasfar away and she must journey long</s> nay you shall not go on your feet my child said motherbrownbreast your friend goldenwing shall carry you</s>  call himhither that i may seat you rightly for if you should fall offmy heart would break</s> then up came goldenwing and bud was safely seated on the cushionof violetleaves and it was really charming to see her merry littleface peeping from under the broad brim of her cowslip hat asher butterfly steed stood waving his bright wings in the sunlight</s> then came the bee with his yellow honeybags which he begged shewould take and the little brown spider that lived under the greatleaves brought a veil for her hat and besought her to wear itlest the sun should shine too brightly while the ant came bringing atiny strawberry lest she should miss her favorite fruit</s>  the mothergave her good advice and the papa stood with his head on one sideand his round eyes twinkling with delight to think that hislittle bud was going to fairyland</s> then they all sang gayly together till she passed out of sightover the hills and they saw her no more</s> and now bud left the old forest far behind her</s>  goldenwingbore her swiftly along and she looked down on the green mountainsand the peasants cottages that stood among overshadowing treesand the earth looked bright with its broad blue rivers windingthrough soft meadows the singing birds and flowers who kept theirbright eyes ever on the sky</s> and she sang gayly as they floated in the clear air while her friendkept time with his waving wings and ever as they went along all grewfairer and thus they came to fairyland</s> as bud passed through the gates she no longer wondered that theexiled fairies wept and sorrowed for the lovely home they had lost</s> bright clouds floated in the sunny sky casting a rainbow light onthe fairy palaces below where the elves were dancing while thelow sweet voices of the singing flowers sounded softly through thefragrant air and mingled with the music of the rippling waves asthey flowed on beneath the blossoming vines that drooped above them</s> all was bright and beautiful but kind little bud would not lingerfor the forms of the weeping fairies were before her andthough the blossoms nodded gayly on their stems to welcome herand the soft winds kissed her cheek she would not stay but onto the flower palace she went into a pleasant hall whose wallswere formed of crimson roses amid whose leaves sat little elvesmaking sweet music on their harps</s>  when they saw bud they gatheredround her and led her through the flowerwreathed arches to a groupof the most beautiful fairies who were gathered about a stately lilyin whose fragrant cup sat one whose purple robe and glittering crowntold she was their queen</s> bud knelt before her and while tears streamed down her little faceshe told her errand and pleaded earnestly that the exiled fairiesmight be forgiven and not be left to pine far from their friends andkindred</s>  and as she prayed many wept with her and when she ceasedand waited for her answer many knelt beside her praying forgivenessfor the unhappy elves</s> with tearful eyes queen dewdrop repliedlittle maiden your prayer has softened my heart</s>  they shall not beleft sorrowing and alone nor shall you go back without a kindly wordto cheer and comfort them</s>  we will pardon their fault and when theycan bring hither a perfect fairy crown robe and wand they shall beagain received as children of their loving queen</s>  the task is hardfor none but the best and purest can form the fairy garments yet withpatience they may yet restore their robes to their former brightness</s> farewell good little maiden come with them for but for you theywould have dwelt for ever without the walls of fairyland</s> good speed to you and farewell cried they all as with lovingmessages to their poor friends they bore her to the gates</s> day after day toiled little bud cheering the fairies whoangry and disappointed would not listen to her gentle wordsbut turned away and sat alone weeping</s>  they grieved her kind heartwith many cruel words but patiently she bore with them and whenthey told her they could never perform so hard a task and must dwellfor ever in the dark forest she answered gently that the snowwhitelily must be planted and watered with repentant tears before therobe of innocence could be won that the sun of love must shinein their hearts before the light could return to their dim crownsand deeds of kindness must be performed ere the power would comeagain to their now useless wands</s> then they planted the lilies but they soon drooped and died andno light came to their crowns</s>  they did no gentle deeds but caredonly for themselves and when they found their labor was in vainthey tried no longer but sat weeping</s>  bud with ceaseless toil andpatient care tended the lilies which bloomed brightly the crownsgrew bright and in her hands the wands had power over birds andblossoms for she was striving to give happiness to othersforgetful of herself</s>  and the idle fairies with thankful words tookthe garments from her and then with bud went forth to fairylandand stood with beating hearts before the gates where crowds of fairyfriends came forth to welcome them</s> but when queen dewdrop touched them with her wand as they passed inthe light faded from their crowns their robes became like witheredleaves and their wands were powerless</s> amid the tears of all the fairies the queen led them to the gatesand saidfarewell</s>  it is not in my power to aid you innocence and love arenot within your hearts and were it not for this untiring littlemaiden who has toiled while you have wept you never would haveentered your lost home</s>  go and strive again for till all is oncemore fair and pure i cannot call you mine</s> farewell</s>  sang the weeping fairies as the gates closed on theiroutcast friends who humbled and brokenhearted gathered around budand she with cheering words guided them back to the forest</s> time passed on and the fairies had done nothing to gain theirlovely home again</s>  they wept no longer but watched little budas she daily tended the flowers restoring their strength and beautyor with gentle words flew from nest to nest teaching the little birdsto live happily together and wherever she went blessings fell andloving hearts were filled with gratitude</s> then one by one the elves secretly did some little work of kindnessand found a quiet joy come back to repay them</s>  flowers lookedlovingly up as they passed birds sang to cheer them when sad thoughtsmade them weep</s>  and soon little bud found out their gentle deedsand her friendly words gave them new strength</s>  so day after daythey followed her and like a band of guardian spirits they flewfar and wide carrying with them joy and peace</s> and not only birds and flowers blessed them but human beings alsofor with tender hands they guided little children from danger andkept their young hearts free from evil thoughts they whisperedsoothing words to the sick and brought sweet odors and fair flowersto their lonely rooms</s>  they sent lovely visions to the old and blindto make their hearts young and bright with happy thoughts</s> but most tenderly did they watch over the poor and sorrowingand many a poor mother blessed the unseen hands that laid foodbefore her hungry little ones and folded warm garments roundtheir naked limbs</s>  many a poor man wondered at the fair flowersthat sprang up in his little gardenplot cheering him with theirbright forms and making his dreary home fair with their lovelinessand looked at his once barren field where now waved the golden cornturning its broad leaves to the warm sun and promising a store ofgolden ears to give him food while the careworn face grew brightand the troubled heart filled with gratitude towards the invisiblespirits who had brought him such joy</s> thus time passed on and though the exiled fairies longed often fortheir home still knowing they did not deserve it they toiled onhoping one day to see the friends they had lost while the joy oftheir own hearts made their life full of happiness</s> one day came little bud to them sayinglisten dear friends</s>  i have a hard task to offer you</s>  it is agreat sacrifice for you light loving fairies to dwell through the longwinter in the dark cold earth watching over the flower roots to keepthem free from the little grubs and worms that seek to harm them</s> but in the sunny spring when they bloom again their love andgratitude will give you happy homes among their bright leaves</s> it is a wearisome task and i can give you no reward for all yourtender care but the blessings of the gentle flowers you will havesaved from death</s>  gladly would i aid you but my winged friends arepreparing for their journey to warmer lands and i must help themteach their little ones to fly and see them safely on their way</s> then through the winter must i seek the dwellings of the poorand suffering comfort the sick and lonely and give hope and courageto those who in their poverty are led astray</s>  these things must i dobut when the flowers bloom again i will be with you to welcome backour friends from over the sea</s> then with tears the fairies answered ah good little bud you havetaken the hardest task yourself and who will repay you for all yourdeeds of tenderness and mercy in the great world</s>  should evil befallyou our hearts would break</s>  we will labor trustingly in the earthand thoughts of you shall cheer us on for without you we had beenworthless beings and never known the joy that kindly actions bring</s> yes dear bud we will gladly toil among the roots that the fairflowers may wear their gayest robes to welcome you</s>
then deep in the earth the fairies dwelt and no frost or snowcould harm the blossoms they tended</s>  every little seed was laidin the soft earth watered and watched</s>  tender roots were foldedin withered leaves that no chilling drops might reach them andsafely dreamed the flowers till summer winds should call them forthwhile lighter grew each fairy heart as every gentle deed wastenderly performed</s> at length the snow was gone and they heard little voices calling themto come up but patiently they worked till seed and root were greenand strong</s>  then with eager feet they hastened to the earth abovewhere over hill and valley bright flowers and budding trees smiledin the warm sunlight blossoms bent lovingly before them and rangtheir colored bells till the fragrant air was full of music whilethe stately trees waved their great arms above them and scatteredsoft leaves at their feet</s> then came the merry birds making the wood alive with their gayvoices calling to one another as they flew among the vinesbuilding their little homes</s>  long waited the elves and at lastshe came with father brownbreast</s>  happy days passed andsummer flowers were in their fullest beauty when bud bade the fairiescome with her</s> mounted on brightwinged butterflies they flew over forest andmeadow till with joyful eyes they saw the flowercrowned wallsof fairyland</s> before the gates they stood and soon troops of loving elvescame forth to meet them</s>  and on through the sunny gardens they wentinto the lily hall where among the golden stamens of a gracefulflower sat the queen while on the broad green leaves around itstood the brighteyed little maids of honor</s> then amid the deep silence little bud leading the fairies to thethrone saiddear queen i here bring back your subjects wiser for their sorrowbetter for their hard trial and now might any queen be proud of themand bow to learn from them that giving joy and peace to othersbrings it fourfold to us bearing a double happiness in the blessingsto those we help</s>  through the dreary months when they might havedwelt among fair southern flowers beneath a smiling sky they toiledin the dark and silent earth filling the hearts of the gentle flowerspirits with grateful love seeking no reward but the knowledge oftheir own good deeds and the joy they always bring</s>  this they havedone unmurmuringly and alone and now far and wide flower blessingsfall upon them and the summer winds bear the glad tidings unto thosewho droop in sorrow and new joy and strength it brings as they looklongingly for the friends whose gentle care hath brought suchhappiness to their fair kindred</s> are they not worthy of your love dear queen</s>  have they not wontheir lovely home</s>  say they are pardoned and you have gainedthe love of hearts pure as the snowwhite robes now folded over them</s> as bud ceased she touched the wondering fairies with her wandand the dark faded garments fell away and beneath the robesof lilyleaves glittered pure and spotless in the sunlight</s> then while happy tears fell queen dewdrop placed the bright crownson the bowed heads of the kneeling fairies and laid before themthe wands their own good deeds had rendered powerful</s> they turned to thank little bud for all her patient lovebut she was gone and high above in the clear air they sawthe little form journeying back to the quiet forest</s> she needed no reward but the joy she had given</s>  the fairy heartswere pure again and her work was done yet all fairyland had learneda lesson from gentle little bud</s> now little sunbeam what have you to tell us</s>  said the queenlooking down on a brighteyed elf who sat half hidden in the deepmoss at her feet</s> i too like startwinkle have nothing but a song to offerreplied the fairy and then while the nightingales sweet voicemingled with her own she sangcloverblossom</s>  in a quiet pleasant meadow  beneath a summer sky where green old trees their branches waved  and winds went singing by where a little brook went rippling  so musically low and passing clouds cast shadows  on the waving grass below where low sweet notes of brooding birds  stole out on the fragrant air and golden sunlight shone undimmed  on all most fresh and fair there bloomed a lovely sisterhood  of happy little flowers together in this pleasant home  through quiet summer hours</s>  no rude hand came to gather them  no chilling winds to blight warm sunbeams smiled on them by day  and soft dews fell at night</s>  so here along the brookside  beneath the green old trees the flowers dwelt among their friends  the sunbeams and the breeze</s>  one morning as the flowers awoke  fragrant and fresh and fair a little worm came creeping by  and begged a shelter there</s>  ah</s>  pity and love me sighed the worm  i am lonely poor and weak a little spot for a restingplace  dear flowers is all i seek</s>  i am not fair and have dwelt unloved  by butterfly bird and bee</s>  they little knew that in this dark form  lay the beauty they yet may see</s>  then let me lie in the deep green moss  and weave my little tomb and sleep my long unbroken sleep  till springs first flowers come</s>  then will i come in a fairer dress  and your gentle care repay by the grateful love of the humble worm  kind flowers o let me stay</s>  but the wild rose showed her little thorns  while her soft face glowed with pride the violet hid beneath the drooping ferns  and the daisy turned aside</s>  little houstonia scornfully laughed  as she danced on her slender stem while the cowslip bent to the rippling waves  and whispered the tale to them</s>  a blueeyed grass looked down on the worm  as it silently turned away and cried thou wilt harm our delicate leaves  and therefore thou canst not stay</s>  then a sweet soft voice called out from far  come hither poor worm to me the sun lies warm in this quiet spot  and ill share my home with thee</s>  the wondering flowers looked up to see  who had offered the worm a home t was a cloverblossom whose fluttering leaves  seemed beckoning him to come it dwelt in a sunny little nook  where cool winds rustled by and murmuring bees and butterflies came  on the flowers breast to lie</s>  down through the leaves the sunlight stole  and seemed to linger there as if it loved to brighten the home  of one so sweet and fair</s>  its rosy face smiled kindly down  as the friendless worm drew near and its low voice softly whispering said  poor thing thou art welcome here close at my side in the soft green moss  thou wilt find a quiet bed where thou canst softly sleep till spring  with my leaves above thee spread</s>  i pity and love thee friendless worm  though thou art not graceful or fair for many a dark unlovely form  hath a kind heart dwelling there no more oer the green and pleasant earth  lonely and poor shalt thou roam for a loving friend hast thou found in me  and rest in my little home</s>  then deep in its quiet mossy bed  sheltered from sun and shower the grateful worm spun its winter tomb  in the shadow of the flower</s>  and clover guarded well its rest  till autumns leaves were sere till all her sister flowers were gone  and her winter sleep drew near</s>  then her withered leaves were softly spread  oer the sleeping worm below ere the faithful little flower lay  beneath the winter snow</s>  spring came again and the flowers rose  from their quiet winter graves and gayly danced on their slender stems  and sang with the rippling waves</s>  softly the warm winds kissed their cheeks  brightly the sunbeams fell as one by one they came again  in their summer homes to dwell</s>  and little clover bloomed once more  rosy and sweet and fair and patiently watched by the mossy bed  for the worm still slumbered there</s>  then her sister flowers scornfully cried  as they waved in the summer air the ugly worm was friendless and poor  little clover why shouldst thou care</s>  then watch no more nor dwell alone  away from thy sister flowers come dance and feast and spend with us  these pleasant summer hours</s>  we pity thee foolish little flower  to trust what the false worm said he will not come in a fairer dress  for he lies in the green moss dead</s>  but little clover still watched on  alone in her sunny home she did not doubt the poor worms truth  and trusted he would come</s>  at last the small cell opened wide  and a glittering butterfly from out the moss on golden wings  soared up to the sunny sky</s>  then the wondering flowers cried aloud  clover thy watch was vain he only sought a shelter here  and never will come again</s>  and the unkind flowers danced for joy  when they saw him thus depart for the love of a beautiful butterfly  is dear to a flowers heart</s>  they feared he would stay in clovers home  and her tender care repay so they danced for joy when at last he rose  and silently flew away</s>  then little clover bowed her head  while her soft tears fell like dew for her gentle heart was grieved to find  that her sisters words were true and the insect she had watched so long  when helpless poor and lone thankless for all her faithful care  on his golden wings had flown</s>  but as she drooped in silent grief  she heard little daisy cry o sisters look</s>  i see him now  afar in the sunny sky he is floating back from cloudland now  borne by the fragrant air</s>  spread wide your leaves that he may choose  the flower he deems most fair</s>  then the wild rose glowed with a deeper blush  as she proudly waved on her stem the cowslip bent to the clear blue waves  and made her mirror of them</s>  little houstonia merrily danced  and spread her white leaves wide while daisy whispered her joy and hope  as she stood by her gay friends side</s>  violet peeped from the tall green ferns  and lifted her soft blue eye to watch the glittering form that shone  afar in the summer sky</s>  they thought no more of the ugly worm  who once had wakened their scorn but looked and longed for the butterfly now  as the soft wind bore him on</s>  nearer and nearer the bright form came  and fairer the blossoms grew each welcomed him in her sweetest tones  each offered her honey and dew</s>  but in vain did they beckon and smile and call  and wider their leaves unclose the glittering form still floated on  by violet daisy and rose</s>  lightly it flew to the pleasant home  of the flower most truly fair on clovers breast he softly lit  and folded his bright wings there</s>  dear flower the butterfly whispered low  long hast thou waited for me now i am come and my grateful love  shall brighten thy home for thee thou hast loved and cared for me when alone  hast watched oer me long and well and now will i strive to show the thanks  the poor worm could not tell</s>  sunbeam and breeze shall come to thee  and the coolest dews that fall whateer a flower can wish is thine  for thou art worthy all</s>  and the home thou shared with the friendless worm  the butterflys home shall be and thou shalt find dear faithful flower  a loving friend in me</s>  then through the long bright summer hours  through sunshine and through shower together in their happy home  dwelt butterfly and flower</s> ah that is very lovely cried the elves gathering roundlittle sunbeam as she ceased to place a garland in her hair andpraise her song</s> now said the queen call hither moonlight and summerwindfor they have seen many pleasant things in their long wanderingsand will gladly tell us them</s> most joyfully will we do our best dear queen said the elvesas they folded their wings beside her</s> now summerwind said moonlight till your turn comes do you sithere and fan me while i tell this tale oflittle annies dream or the fairy flower</s> in a large and pleasant garden sat little annie all alone andshe seemed very sad for drops that were not dew fell fast upon theflowers beside her who looked wonderingly up and bent still neareras if they longed to cheer and comfort her</s>  the warm wind lifted upher shining hair and softly kissed her cheek while the sunbeamslooking most kindly in her face made little rainbows in her tearsand lingered lovingly about her</s>  but annie paid no heed to sunor wind or flower still the bright tears fell and she forgotall but her sorrow</s> little annie tell me why you weep said a low voice in her earand looking up the child beheld a little figure standing on avineleaf at her side a lovely face smiled on her from amidbright locks of hair and shining wings were folded on a white andglittering robe that fluttered in the wind</s> who are you lovely little thing</s>  cried annie smiling throughher tears</s> i am a fairy little child and am come to help and comfort you nowtell me why you weep and let me be your friend replied the spiritas she smiled more kindly still on annies wondering face</s> and are you really then a little elf such as i read ofin my fairy books</s>  do you ride on butterflies sleep in flowercupsand live among the clouds</s> yes all these things i do and many stranger still that allyour fairy books can never tell but now dear annie said the fairybending nearer tell me why i found no sunshine on your face why arethese great drops shining on the flowers and why do you sit alonewhen bird and bee are calling you to play</s> ah you will not love me any more if i should tell you allsaid annie while the tears began to fall again i am not happyfor i am not good how shall i learn to be a patient gentle child</s> good little fairy will you teach me how</s> gladly will i aid you annie and if you truly wish to bea happy child you first must learn to conquer many passions thatyou cherish now and make your heart a home for gentle feelings andhappy thoughts the task is hard but i will give this fairy flowerto help and counsel you</s>  bend hither that i may place it in yourbreast no hand can take it hence till i unsay the spell thatholds it there</s> as thus she spoke the elf took from her bosom a graceful flowerwhose snowwhite leaves shone with a strange soft light</s>  this isa fairy flower said the elf invisible to every eye save yoursnow listen while i tell its power annie</s>  when your heart is filledwith loving thoughts when some kindly deed has been done some dutywell performed then from the flower there will arise the sweetestsoftest fragrance to reward and gladden you</s>  but when an unkind wordis on your lips when a selfish angry feeling rises in your heartor an unkind cruel deed is to be done then will you hear the softlow chime of the flowerbell listen to its warning let the wordremain unspoken the deed undone and in the quiet joy of your ownheart and the magic perfume of your bosom flower you will finda sweet reward</s> o kind and generous fairy how can i ever thank you for this lovelygift</s>  cried annie</s>  i will be true and listen to my little bellwhenever it may ring</s>  but shall i never see you more</s>  ah</s>  if youwould only stay with me i should indeed be good</s> i cannot stay now little annie said the elf but whenanother spring comes round i shall be here again to see how wellthe fairy gift has done its work</s>  and now farewell dear childbe faithful to yourself and the magic flower will never fade</s> then the gentle fairy folded her little arms around annies necklaid a soft kiss on her cheek and spreading wide her shining wingsflew singing up among the white clouds floating in the sky</s> and little annie sat among her flowers and watched with wondering joythe fairy blossom shining on her breast</s>
when first the fairy placed it there she had been pleased withher new gift and for a while obeyed the fairy bell and often triedto win some fragrance from the flower by kind and pleasant wordsand actions then as the fairy said she found a sweet reward inthe strange soft perfume of the magic blossom as it shone upon herbreast but selfish thoughts would come to tempt her she would yieldand unkind words fell from her lips and then the flower drooped paleand scentless the fairy bell rang mournfully annie would forgether better resolutions and be again a selfish wilful little child</s> at last she tried no longer but grew angry with the faithful flowerand would have torn it from her breast but the fairy spell stillheld it fast and all her angry words but made it ring a loudersadder peal</s>  then she paid no heed to the silvery music soundingin her ear and each day grew still more unhappy discontentedand unkind so when the autumn days came round she was no betterfor the gentle fairys gift and longed for spring that it mightbe returned for now the constant echo of the mournful music made hervery sad</s> one sunny morning when the fresh cool winds were blowingand not a cloud was in the sky little annie walked among her flowerslooking carefully into each hoping thus to find the fairy who alonecould take the magic blossom from her breast</s>  but she lifted up theirdrooping leaves peeped into their dewy cups in vain no little elflay hidden there and she turned sadly from them all saying i willgo out into the fields and woods and seek her there</s>  i will notlisten to this tiresome music more nor wear this withered flowerlonger</s>  so out into the fields she went where the long grassrustled as she passed and timid birds looked at her from their nestswhere lovely wildflowers nodded in the wind and opened wide theirfragrant leaves to welcome in the murmuring bees while butterflieslike winged flowers danced and glittered in the sun</s> little annie looked searched and asked them all if any onecould tell her of the fairy whom she sought but the birds lookedwonderingly at her with their soft bright eyes and still sang onthe flowers nodded wisely on their stems but did not speakwhile butterfly and bee buzzed and fluttered away one far too busythe other too idle to stay and tell her what she asked</s> then she went through broad fields of yellow grain that wavedaround her like a golden forest here crickets chirped grasshoppersleaped and busy ants worked but they could not tell her whatshe longed to know</s> now will i go among the hills said annie she may be there</s> so up and down the green hillsides went her little feet long shesearched and vainly she called but still no fairy came</s>  thenby the riverside she went and asked the gay dragonflies and thecool white lilies if the fairy had been there but the blue wavesrippled on the white sand at her feet and no voice answered her</s> then into the forest little annie went and as she passed along thedim cool paths the woodflowers smiled up in her face gay squirrelspeeped at her as they swung amid the vines and doves cooed softlyas she wandered by but none could answer her</s>  so weary withher long and useless search she sat amid the ferns and feastedon the rosy strawberries that grew beside her watching meanwhilethe crimson evening clouds that glowed around the setting sun</s> the nightwind rustled through the boughs rocking the flowersto sleep the wild birds sang their evening hymns and all withinthe wood grew calm and still paler and paler grew the purple lightlower and lower drooped little annies head the tall ferns bentto shield her from the dew the whispering pines sang a soft lullabyand when the autumn moon rose up her silver light shone on the childwhere pillowed on green moss she lay asleep amid the woodflowersin the dim old forest</s> and all night long beside her stood the fairy she had sought andby elfin spell and charm sent to the sleeping child this dream</s> little annie dreamed she sat in her own garden as she had oftensat before with angry feelings in her heart and unkind words uponher lips</s>  the magic flower was ringing its soft warning but she paidno heed to anything save her own troubled thoughts thus she satwhen suddenly a low voice whispered in her earlittle annie look and see the evil things that you are cherishingi will clothe in fitting shapes the thoughts and feelings that nowdwell within your heart and you shall see how great their powerbecomes unless you banish them for ever</s> then annie saw with fear and wonder that the angry words she utteredchanged to dark unlovely forms each showing plainly from what faultor passion it had sprung</s>  some of the shapes had scowling faces andbright fiery eyes these were the spirits of anger</s>  others withsullen anxious looks seemed gathering up all they could reach andannie saw that the more they gained the less they seemed to haveand these she knew were shapes of selfishness</s>  spirits of pride werethere who folded their shadowy garments round them and turnedscornfully away from all the rest</s>  these and many otherslittle annie saw which had come from her own heart and taken formbefore her eyes</s> when first she saw them they were small and weak but as she lookedthey seemed to grow and gather strength and each gained astrange power over her</s>  she could not drive them from her sightand they grew ever stronger darker and more unlovely to her eyes</s> they seemed to cast black shadows over all around to dim thesunshine blight the flowers and drive away all bright and lovelythings while rising slowly round her annie saw a high dark wallthat seemed to shut out everything she loved she dared not moveor speak but with a strange fear at her heart sat watching the dimshapes that hovered round her</s> higher and higher rose the shadowy wall slowly the flowers near herdied lingeringly the sunlight faded but at last they both were goneand left her all alone behind the gloomy wall</s>  then the spiritsgathered round her whispering strange things in her ear bidding herobey for by her own will she had yielded up her heart to be theirhome and she was now their slave</s>  then she could hear no more butsinking down among the withered flowers wept sad and bitter tearsfor her lost liberty and joy then through the gloom there shonea faint soft light and on her breast she saw her fairy flowerupon whose snowwhite leaves her tears lay shining</s> clearer and brighter grew the radiant light till the evil spiritsturned away to the dark shadow of the wall and left the child alone</s> the light and perfume of the flower seemed to bring new strengthto annie and she rose up saying as she bent to kiss the blossomon her breast dear flower help and guide me now and i will listento your voice and cheerfully obey my faithful fairy bell</s> then in her dream she felt how hard the spirits tried to temptand trouble her and how but for her flower they would have ledher back and made all dark and dreary as before</s>  long and hardshe struggled and tears often fell but after each new trialbrighter shone her magic flower and sweeter grew its breath whilethe spirits lost still more their power to tempt her</s>  meanwhilegreen flowering vines crept up the high dark wall and hid itsroughness from her sight and over these she watched most tenderlyfor soon wherever green leaves and flowers bloomed the wall beneathgrew weak and fell apart</s>  thus little annie worked and hopedtill one by one the evil spirits fled away and in their placecame shining forms with gentle eyes and smiling lips who gatheredround her with such loving words and brought such strength and joyto annies heart that nothing evil dared to enter in while slowlysank the gloomy wall and over wreaths of fragrant flowers shepassed out into the pleasant world again the fairy gift no longerpale and drooping but now shining like a star upon her breast</s> then the low voice spoke again in annies sleeping ear sayingthe dark unlovely passions you have looked upon are in your heartwatch well while they are few and weak lest they should darken yourwhole life and shut out love and happiness for ever</s>  remember wellthe lesson of the dream dear child and let the shining spiritsmake your heart their home</s> and with that voice sounding in her ear little annie woke to findit was a dream but like other dreams it did not pass away and as shesat alone bathed in the rosy morning light and watched the forestwaken into life she thought of the strange forms she had seen andlooking down upon the flower on her breast she silently resolved tostrive as she had striven in her dream to bring back light andbeauty to its faded leaves by being what the fairy hoped to renderher a patient gentle little child</s>  and as the thought came to hermind the flower raised its drooping head and looking up into theearnest little face bent over it seemed by its fragrant breath toanswer annies silent thought and strengthen her for what might come</s> meanwhile the forest was astir birds sang their gay goodmorrowsfrom tree to tree while leaf and flower turned to greet the sunwho rose up smiling on the world and so beneath the forest boughsand through the dewy fields went little annie home better and wiserfor her dream</s> autumn flowers were dead and gone yellow leaves lay rustling on theground bleak winds went whistling through the naked trees and coldwhite winter snow fell softly down yet now when all without lookeddark and dreary on little annies breast the fairy flower bloomedmore beautiful than ever</s>  the memory of her forest dream had neverpassed away and through trial and temptation she had been true andkept her resolution still unbroken seldom now did the warning bellsound in her ear and seldom did the flowers fragrance cease to floatabout her or the fairy light to brighten all whereon it fell</s> so through the long cold winter little annie dwelt like a sunbeamin her home each day growing richer in the love of others andhappier in herself often was she tempted but remembering her dreamshe listened only to the music of the fairy bell and the unkindthought or feeling fled away the smiling spirits of gentlenessand love nestled in her heart and all was bright again</s> so better and happier grew the child fairer and sweeter grew theflower till spring came smiling over the earth and woke the flowersset free the streams and welcomed back the birds then daily didthe happy child sit among her flowers longing for the gentle elfto come again that she might tell her gratitude for all the magicgift had done</s> at length one day as she sat singing in the sunny nook whereall her fairest flowers bloomed weary with gazing at the faroff skyfor the little form she hoped would come she bent to look with joyfullove upon her bosom flower and as she looked its folded leavesspread wide apart and rising slowly from the deep white cupappeared the smiling face of the lovely elf whose coming she hadwaited for so long</s> dear annie look for me no longer i am here on your own breastfor you have learned to love my gift and it has done its workmost faithfully and well the fairy said as she looked into thehappy childs bright face and laid her little arms most tenderlyabout her neck</s> and now have i brought another gift from fairyland as a fit rewardfor you dear child she said when annie had told all her gratitudeand love then touching the child with her shining wand the fairybid her look and listen silently</s> and suddenly the world seemed changed to annie for the air was filledwith strange sweet sounds and all around her floated lovely forms</s> in every flower sat little smiling elves singing gayly as they rockedamid the leaves</s>  on every breeze bright airy spirits came floatingby some fanned her cheek with their cool breath and waved her longhair to and fro while others rang the flowerbells and made apleasant rustling among the leaves</s>  in the fountain where the waterdanced and sparkled in the sun astride of every drop she saw merrylittle spirits who plashed and floated in the clear cool waves andsang as gayly as the flowers on whom they scattered glittering dew</s> the tall trees as their branches rustled in the wind sang a lowdreamy song while the waving grass was filled with little voicesshe had never heard before</s>  butterflies whispered lovely tales inher ear and birds sang cheerful songs in a sweet language she hadnever understood before</s>  earth and air seemed filled with beautyand with music she had never dreamed of until now</s>
 is it another and a lovelierdream or is the earth in truth so beautiful as this</s>  she criedlooking with wondering joy upon the elf who lay upon the flowerin her breast</s> yes it is true dear child replied the fairy and few are themortals to whom we give this lovely gift what to you is now so fullof music and of light to others is but a pleasant summer worldthey never know the language of

visit you and bringsome fairy gift</s>  guard well the magic flower that i may find allfair and bright when next i come</s> then with a kind farewell the gentle fairy floated upwardthrough the sunny air smiling down upon the child until she vanishedin the soft white clouds and little annie stood alone in herenchanted garden where all was brightened with the radiant lightand fragrant with the perfume of her fairy flower</s> when moonlight ceased summerwind laid down her roseleaf fan andleaning back in her acorn cup told this tale ofripple the waterspirit</s> down in the deep blue sea lived ripple a happy little waterspiritall day long she danced beneath the coral arches made garlandsof bright ocean flowers or floated on the great waves that sparkledin the sunlight but the pastime that she loved best was lyingin the manycolored shells upon the shore listening to the lowmurmuring music the waves had taught them long ago and herefor hours the little spirit lay watching the sea and sky whilesinging gayly to herself</s> but when tempests rose she hastened down below the stormy billowsto where all was calm and still and with her sister spirits waitedtill it should be fair again listening sadly meanwhile to the criesof those whom the wild waves wrecked and cast into the angry seaand who soon came floating down pale and cold to the spiritspleasant home then they wept pitying tears above the lifeless formsand laid them in quiet graves where flowers bloomed and jewelssparkled in the sand</s> this was ripples only grief and she often thought of those whosorrowed for the friends they loved who now slept far down in the dimand silent coral caves and gladly would she have saved the livesof those who lay around her but the great ocean was far mightier thanall the tenderhearted spirits dwelling in its bosom</s>  thus she couldonly weep for them and lay them down to sleep where no cruel wavescould harm them more</s> one day when a fearful storm raged far and wide and the spirits sawgreat billows rolling like heavy clouds above their heads and heardthe wild winds sounding far away down through the foaming wavesa little child came floating to their home its eyes were closed as ifin sleep the long hair fell like seaweed round its pale cold faceand the little hands still clasped the shells they had been gatheringon the beach when the great waves swept it into the troubled sea</s> with tender tears the spirits laid the little form to rest upon itsbed of flowers and singing mournful songs as if to make its sleepmore calm and deep watched long and lovingly above it till the stormhad died away and all was still again</s> while ripple sang above the little child through the distant roarof winds and waves she heard a wild sorrowing voice that seemed tocall for help</s>  long she listened thinking it was but the echo oftheir own plaintive song but high above the music still soundedthe sad wailing cry</s>  then stealing silently away she glided upthrough foam and spray till through the parting clouds the sunlightshone upon her from the tranquil sky and guided by the mournfulsound she floated on till close before her on the beach she sawa woman stretching forth her arms and with a sad imploring voicepraying the restless sea to give her back the little child it hadso cruelly borne away</s>  but the waves dashed foaming up among thebare rocks at her feet mingling their cold spray with her tearsand gave no answer to her prayer</s> when ripple saw the mothers grief she longed to comfort herso bending tenderly beside her where she knelt upon the shorethe little spirit told her how her child lay softly sleeping far downin a lovely place where sorrowing tears were shed and gentle handslaid garlands over him</s>  but all in vain she whispered kindly wordsthe weeping mother only crieddear spirit can you use no charm or spell to make the waves bringback my child as full of life and strength as when they swept himfrom my side</s>  o give me back my little child or let me lie besidehim in the bosom of the cruel sea</s> most gladly will i help you if i can though i have little powerto use then grieve no more for i will

when ripple first began her airy journey all was dark and drearyheavy clouds lay piled like hills around her and a cold mistfilled the air but the sunbeam like a star lit up the way the leaflay warmly round her and the tireless wind went swiftly on</s>  higherand higher they floated up still darker and darker grew the aircloser the damp mist gathered while the black clouds rolled andtossed like great waves to and fro</s> ah</s>  sighed the weary little spirit shall i never see the lightagain or feel the warm winds on my cheek</s>  it is a dreary way indeedand but for the seasons gifts i should have perished long ago butthe heavy clouds must pass away at last and all be fair again</s> so hasten on good breeze and bring me quickly to my journeys end</s> soon the cold vapors vanished from her path and sunshine shoneupon her pleasantly so she went gayly on till she came up amongthe stars where many new strange sights were to be seen</s>  withwondering eyes she looked upon the bright worlds that once seemed dimand distant when she gazed upon them from the sea but now they movedaround her some shining with a softly radiant light some circledwith bright manycolored rings while others burned with a redangry glare</s>  ripple would have gladly stayed to watch them longerfor she fancied low sweet voices called her and lovely facesseemed to look upon her as she passed but higher up still nearerto the sun she saw a faroff light that glittered like a brilliantcrimson star and seemed to cast a rosy glow along the sky</s> the firespirits surely must be there and i must stay no longerhere said ripple</s>  so steadily she floated on till straightbefore her lay a broad bright path that led up to a golden archbeyond which she could see shapes flitting to and fro</s>  as she drewnear brighter glowed the sky hotter and hotter grew the air tillripples leafcloak shrivelled up and could no longer shield her fromthe heat then she unfolded the white snowflake and gladly wrappingthe soft cool mantle round her entered through the shining arch</s> through the red mist that floated all around her she could seehigh walls of changing light where orange blue and violet flameswent flickering to and fro making graceful figures as they dancedand glowed and underneath these rainbow arches little spiritsglided far and near wearing crowns of fire beneath which flashedtheir wild bright eyes and as they spoke sparks dropped quicklyfrom their lips and ripple saw with wonder through their garmentsof transparent light that in each fairys breast there burned asteady flame that never wavered or went out</s> as thus she stood the spirits gathered round her and theirhot breath would have scorched her but she drew the snowcloakcloser round her sayingtake me to your queen that i may tell her why i am here and askfor what i seek</s> so through long halls of manycolored fire they led her toa spirit fairer than the rest whose crown of flames waved to and frolike golden plumes while underneath her violet robe the lightwithin her breast glowed bright and strong</s> this is our queen the spirits said bending low before heras she turned her gleaming eyes upon the stranger they had brought</s> then ripple told how she had wandered round the world in searchof them how the seasons had most kindly helped her on by givingsunbeam breeze leaf and flake and how through many dangers shehad come at last to ask of them the magic flame that could give lifeto the little child again</s>
when she had told her tale the spirits whispered earnestlyamong themselves while sparks fell thick and fast with every wordat length the firequeen said aloudwe cannot give the flame you ask for each

the jewels melted like snow and fell in bright drops to theground at this the queens eyes flashed and the spirits gatheredangrily about poor ripple who looked sadly at the broken chainand thought in vain what she could give to win the thing she longedso earnestly for</s> i have many fairer gems than these in my home below the seaand i will bring all i can gather far and wide if you will grantmy

what they asked most surelyshould be done</s>  so each one gave a little of the fire from theirbreasts and placed the flame in a crystal vase through whichit shone and glittered like a star</s> then bidding her remember all she had promised them they led herto the golden arch and said farewell</s> so down along the shining path through mist and cloud shetravelled back till far below she saw the broad blue sea she leftso long ago</s> gladly she plunged into the clear cool waves and floated backto her pleasant home where the spirits gathered joyfully about herlistening with tears and smiles as she told all her many wanderingsand showed the crystal vase that she had brought</s> now come said they and finish the good work you have so bravelycarried on</s>  so to the quiet tomb they went where like a marbleimage cold and still the little child was lying</s>  then ripple placedthe flame upon his breast and watched it gleam and sparkle therewhile light came slowly back into the once dim eyes a rosy glow shoneover the pale face and breath stole through the parted lips stillbrighter and warmer burned the magic fire until the child awokefrom his long sleep and looked in smiling wonder at the faces bendingover him</s> then ripple sang for joy and with her sister spirits robed thechild in graceful garments woven of bright seaweed while inhis shining hair they wreathed long garlands of their fairest flowersand on his little arms hung chains of brilliant shells</s> now come with us dear child said ripple we will bear you safelyup into the sunlight and the pleasant air for this is not your

brokesparkling at her feet the lonely mother still stood gazing wistfullyacross the sea</s>  suddenly upon a great blue billow that came rollingin she saw the waterspirits smiling on her and high aloft in theirwhite gleaming arms her child stretched forth his hands to welcomeher while the little voice she so longed to hear again cried gaylysee dear mother i am come and look what lovely things

upon her faithful breeze once more wentjourneying through the sky</s> the spirits gladly welcomed her and led her to the queenbefore whom she poured out the sparkling gems she had gatheredwith such toil and care but when the spirits tried to form theminto crowns they trickled from their hands like colored drops of dewand ripple saw with fear and sorrow how they melted one by one awaytill none of

breathe the flames thatgive you life and but for this snowmantle i too should melt awayand vanish like the jewels in your hands</s>  o dear spirits give mesome other task but let me go from this warm

began to lifther mantle off but underneath they saw the pearl chain shining witha clear soft light that only glowed more brightly when they laidtheir hands upon it</s> o give us this</s>  cried they
